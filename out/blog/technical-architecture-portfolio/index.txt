a:"$Sreact.suspense"
b:T1939,<p>This post outlines the technical architecture and design decisions behind my personal portfolio website. The project started after I saw a Reddit comment suggesting, "For a startup, get a landing page with Magic UI."</p>
<p>While researching that for my own startup, I came across dillionverma/portfolio. I liked the clean, Apple-inspired design and precise UI interactions, so I decided to adapt it first as my personal site. Over time, it evolved into a technical playground to showcase my experiments, projects, and ideas.</p>
<h2>1. Core Technology Stack &#x26; Configuration</h2>
<p>The stack was chosen to balance performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability.</p>
<p><strong>Framework</strong>: The portfolio is built with Next.js 14, using the new App Router for file-based routing and built-in server-side rendering capabilities. I configured <code>next.config.mjs</code> with <code>output: 'export'</code> to generate a fully static export, making it easy to host on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong>: TypeScript is used throughout, providing strict type safety and reducing runtime errors. The <code>tsconfig.json</code> enforces strict mode and defines path aliases (e.g., <code>@/*</code>) to simplify and clarify imports.</p>
<p><strong>Styling</strong>: Tailwind CSS is the primary styling framework, with custom configurations defined in <code>tailwind.config.ts</code>. The setup integrates <code>tailwindcss-animate</code> for fine-tuned keyframe animations and supports both light and dark modes via a ThemeProvider.</p>
<p><strong>UI Components</strong>: The UI layer combines shadcn/ui and Magic UI. Unlike external black-box libraries, these components live directly in <code>src/components/ui/</code>, making them fully customizable.</p>
<p><strong>3D Graphics &#x26; Animations</strong>: Three.js, rendered via React Three Fiber, is used for interactive 3D visualizations. Helper components from <code>@react-three/drei</code> simplify common tasks such as camera controls and geometry setup. Framer Motion powers animations throughout the UI, from dock hover interactions to scroll-triggered reveals.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>: Automated deployment is set up using GitHub Actions. Each push triggers a build (via pnpm), generates the static site, and deploys directly to GitHub Pages, providing a predictable and reproducible release process.</p>
<h2>2. Component Architecture</h2>
<p>The frontend is designed around modular, reusable components, with a strong emphasis on composability and clarity.</p>
<h3>Navigation and Dock</h3>
<p><strong>Navbar &#x26; Dock</strong> (<code>src/components/navbar.tsx</code>, <code>src/components/magicui/dock.tsx</code>):
The main navigation includes a macOS-style dock that scales icons dynamically based on cursor proximity, implemented with framer-motion. The Navbar also includes a dark/light mode toggle and a button to activate an Aquarium overlay for additional visual detail.</p>
<h3>Cards</h3>
<p><strong>ResumeCard &#x26; ProjectCard</strong> (<code>src/components/resume-card.tsx</code>, <code>src/components/project-card.tsx</code>):
Cards are used extensively across "Work," "Education," and "Projects" sections. These components can expand and collapse with animated transitions, and support dynamic content like tech stacks, video previews, and links.</p>
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong> (<code>src/components/table-of-contents.tsx</code>):
A floating, scroll-synced navigation element uses IntersectionObserver to track which page section is currently in view. This improves user orientation and overall navigation on longer pages.</p>
<h3>Interactive Visualizations</h3>
<p><strong>Rubik's Cube</strong> (<code>src/components/rubiks-cube.tsx</code>):
A fully animated 3D Rubik's Cube built with React Three Fiber. The solver class implements the CFOP method and executes each stage in real time using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> for smooth, incremental rotations.</p>
<p><strong>Maps</strong> (<code>src/components/world-map.tsx</code>, <code>src/components/hong-kong-map.tsx</code>):
The world map uses react-simple-maps and d3-geo to highlight visited countries. The Hong Kong map uses react-leaflet with categorized custom markers to show local points of interest.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub Contributions</strong> (<code>src/components/github-contributions.tsx</code>):
Fetches contribution data from GitHub's GraphQL API and renders it as a heatmap, similar to the official GitHub profile view. Includes responsive layout and loading states for smooth performance.</p>
<h3>Showcase Visualizations</h3>
<p><strong>Protein Folding</strong> (<code>src/components/protein-folding.tsx</code>):
Visualizes the folding of a polypeptide backbone using TubeGeometry, with color coding based on predicted confidence (inspired by pLDDT). Includes a 2D PAE plot rendered on <code>&#x3C;canvas></code>, providing additional structural uncertainty insight.</p>
<p><strong>Torus-Mug Morph</strong> (<code>src/components/torus-mug-morph.tsx</code>):
A demonstration of topological equivalence between a torus and a coffee mug. Vertex positions and normals are interpolated using custom <code>lerpArray</code> and <code>lerpColor</code> utilities, allowing real-time shape morphing controlled by a slider.</p>
<h3>UI Effects and Additional Features</h3>
<p><strong>BlurFade Components</strong> (<code>src/components/magicui/blur-fade.tsx</code>, <code>src/components/magicui/blur-fade-text.tsx</code>):
Implements staggered fade-in animations for text and UI elements as they scroll into view, using framer-motion hooks.</p>
<p><strong>Aquarium Overlay</strong> (<code>src/components/aquarium.tsx</code>):
A toggleable, animated overlay with fish and shrimp that move dynamically across the screen. Motion is handled via <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, with boundary collision logic to simulate natural movement.</p>
<h3>Commonplace Book</h3>
<p>The "Commonplace Book" section functions as a living record of books and essays that influence my thinking. Rather than simply listing titles, it serves as a curated, transparent window into what shapes my ideas and approaches.</p>
<h2>3. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This portfolio is designed as both a personal website and a technical sandbox by combining Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Magic UI, and advanced visualization libraries like React Three Fiber.</p>2:["$","section",null,{"id":"blog","children":[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BlogPosting\",\"headline\":\"Technical breakdown of this personal portfolio: Architecture, Components, and 3D Visualizations\",\"datePublished\":\"2025-07-07T04:36:00+08:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2025-07-07T04:36:00+08:00\",\"description\":\"A deep dive into the technical architecture and design decisions behind my personal portfolio website, featuring 3D visualizations, interactive maps, and modern web technologies.\",\"image\":\"https://rohitmanvar.github.io/og?title=Technical breakdown of this personal portfolio: Architecture, Components, and 3D Visualizations\",\"url\":\"https://rohitmanvar.github.io/blog/technical-architecture-portfolio\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Rohit Manvar\"}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"title font-medium text-2xl tracking-tighter max-w-[650px]","children":"Technical breakdown of this personal portfolio: Architecture, Components, and 3D Visualizations"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex justify-between items-center mt-2 mb-8 text-sm max-w-[650px]","children":["$","$a",null,{"fallback":["$","p",null,{"className":"h-5"}],"children":["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400","children":"July 7, 2025 (3mo ago)"}]}]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$b"}}]]}]
